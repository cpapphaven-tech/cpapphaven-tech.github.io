            <h2>About Traffic Jam</h2>
            <p>Traffic Jam is a classic spatial reasoning puzzle where you take the role of a traffic controller in a
                congested city parking lot. Your goal is simple but challenging: get the red car to the exit gate on the
                right side of the grid. However, the path is blocked by various trucks and cars that can only move along
                their own axis.</p>

            <p>With dozens of levels ranging from "Beginner" to "Expert", Traffic Jam will test your ability to plan
                several moves ahead. Each car you move affects the board's state, creating a domino effect of
                possibilities. It's a perfect blend of strategy and logic, rendered in high-fidelity 3D with smooth
                isometric camera angles.</p>

            <h3>Rules of the Road</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Horizontal Cars:</strong> Can only slide left and right.</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical Cars:</strong> Can only slide up and down.</li>
                <li><strong>The Exit:</strong> Slide the Red Car all the way to the green gate on the right to win.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scoring and Logic</h3>
            <p>Each level is cleared once the red sports car exits the grid. Your logic is tested by how few moves you
                can use to clear the path, though the primary goal is simply to solve the puzzle and advance to the next
                challenge.</p>

            <h3>Puzzle Tips</h3>
            <p>Before moving any car, try to look at the 'Main Obstacle'—the car directly blocking the red one. Work
                backwards: what needs to move to get that obstacle out of the way? This reverse-engineering strategy is
                the key to solving the Expert levels!</p>
