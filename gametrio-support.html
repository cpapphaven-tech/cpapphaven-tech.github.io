        <h2>📌 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>1. How do I play the games?</h3>
        <p>
            Each game includes its own instructions and tutorial.
            You can find “How to Play” information inside each game before you start playing.

        <h3>2. Do the games save my progress?</h3>
        <p>

            PlayMix Games is free to play and uses <strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</strong>
and <strong>ironSource (by Unity)</strong> to support ongoing development.
