  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> Habit Tracker</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>This Habit Tracker app is designed to help you build better routines while respecting your privacy.
We collect only the minimum information needed to provide core app features. Some features operate completely offline, while the app also uses third-party services such as Firebase and Google Mobile Ads for analytics, crash reporting, and advertising.</p>

  <h2>2. Personal data we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>The app does not ask you to create an account and does not collect personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or financial details.</strong></p>
  <p>Your entries remain stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and usage data</h2>
  <p>To help improve performance and stability, the app uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> and <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>. These may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID or instance ID)</li>
    <li>App version and OS version</li>
    <li>Crash logs</li>
    <li>Usage events (e.g., screen views, feature interactions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used in aggregate and not linked to your identity.</p>

  <h2>4. Advertising (Google Mobile Ads)</h2>
  <p>The app displays banner advertisements using <strong>Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob)</strong>. AdMob may collect and process certain data, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (e.g., device model, OS version)</li>
    <li>General location (city-level, not precise GPS)</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA on iOS)</li>
    <li>Interaction data with ads (e.g., views, clicks)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AdMob uses this data to deliver and improve ads. You can manage or reset your advertising identifier in your device settings.</p>
  <p>Google's advertising policies apply. You may review them on Google's official privacy page.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics</strong> — performance monitoring and crash reporting</li>
    <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</strong> — displaying ads in the app</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Storage and retention</h2>
  <p>Your personal data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded to any server by the app. Data remains on the device until you delete it or uninstall the app.</p>

  <h2>7. iCloud and remote servers</h2>
  <p>The app does not use iCloud sync or store your data on external servers.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not intended for children under 4. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Because the app does not collect personal information that identifies you, you do not need to request data deletion. To remove your data, simply delete entries from within the app or uninstall the app.</p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>The app stores all data locally. Please use device-level protections (PIN, Face ID, Touch ID) to keep your data secure.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.</p>
