  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> Number Merge: MergeUp</p>
 

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>Number Merge: MergeUp is a casual puzzle game that helps players merge numbers and solve daily challenges. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what information the app may collect, why, and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local game data:</strong> Your game progress, scores, daily challenge results and local settings are stored on your device only.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and crash data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to collect aggregated, non-identifying technical data (app version, OS version, crash stack traces, basic usage events) to improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> The app displays ads using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). AdMob may collect device-level information (advertising ID, device model, approximate location at city level, ad interactions) to deliver and improve ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. No Account Required</h2>
  <p>The app does not require you to create an account or sign in. We do not collect personal contact details (name, email, phone) unless you explicitly provide them via the support email or feedback forms.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To improve app stability and features (via aggregated analytics).</li>
    <li>To deliver and personalize ads (via AdMob), if enabled by the ad network.</li>
    <li>To respond to support requests if you contact us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services that have their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> — analytics and crash reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</strong> — serves ads in the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please review Google’s privacy pages for details about their data handling and opt-out options.</p>

  <h2>6. Advertising & Opt-out</h2>
  <p>AdMob may use advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA on iOS) for ad personalization. To opt out of ad personalization, adjust your device settings (iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking). You can also reset your advertising identifier via device settings.</p>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not intended for children under 4 We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 4. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, contact us at the support email below and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>8. Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Local game data is stored on your device. We do not store your gameplay data on our servers unless you explicitly export or share it. Analytics data retained by third parties is governed by their policies.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Because the app does not collect personal data tied to your identity by default, there is limited personal data to request. If you wish to delete exported data or request removal of any personal information you shared with us, contact <a href="mailto:cpapphaven@gmail.com">cpapphaven@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data stored on device and data transmitted to third parties. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
