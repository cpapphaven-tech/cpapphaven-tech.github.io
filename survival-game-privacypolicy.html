<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App: Shooter Survival: Zombie Wave</strong></p>

<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>
  Shooter Survival: Zombie Wave is an action game where players fight waves of zombies, upgrade abilities, and track progress. 
  The game runs primarily on your device but uses third-party services such as Firebase and Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) for analytics, crash reporting, and advertising.
</p>

<h2>2. Personal data we collect</h2>
<p>
  The game does not require you to create an account and does not collect personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or precise location.
</p>
<p>
  Gameplay data (progress, upgrades, coins, waves reached) is stored locally on your device and is not uploaded by us to any server.
</p>

<h2>3. Analytics and usage data</h2>
<p>The game uses Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to help us improve performance and stability. These services may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID or Firebase Instance ID)</li>
  <li>App version and operating system details</li>
  <li>Crash logs and error reports</li>
  <li>Basic usage events such as session length or feature interactions</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is aggregated and not linked to your identity.</p>

<h2>4. Advertising (Google Mobile Ads)</h2>
<p>
  The game displays ads, including banner ads and rewarded ads, using Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob). 
  AdMob may collect and process:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
  <li>Approximate location (city-level, not GPS)</li>
  <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA on iOS)</li>
  <li>Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This data helps deliver relevant ads and improve ad quality.  
  You can manage or reset your device’s advertising identifier in your iOS settings.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
<p>The game uses the following external services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — anonymous usage reporting</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> — crash diagnostics</li>
  <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</strong> — in-game advertising</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Storage and retention</h2>
<p>
  All gameplay data is stored locally on your device.  
  No gameplay or personal data is uploaded to any server by the app.  
  Data will remain on your device until you delete it or uninstall the game.
</p>

<h2>7. iCloud and remote servers</h2>
<p>
  The game does not use iCloud sync and does not store gameplay data on remote servers.
</p>

<h2>8. Children</h2>
<p>
  The game is not intended for children under the age of 4.  
  The game does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>9. Your rights</h2>
<p>
  Since the game does not collect personal information that identifies you, you do not need to submit data deletion requests.  
  To remove your gameplay data, simply delete your progress manually (if supported) or uninstall the game.
</p>

<h2>10. Security</h2>
<p>
  All game data is stored locally on your device.  
  We recommend using device-level protections such as a passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
  Changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the game indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
